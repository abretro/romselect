# romselect

romselect.py is a script that extracts a single rom from a multi-rom archive, then compresses it and puts it in the right folder in ~/RetroPie/roms

its primary usage seems to be with NES roms, where most of them are unplayable in multi-rom form on many emulators, but selecting the single specifc rom lets that single rom play.
